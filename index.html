      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a hardworking single mom who has always wanted to code!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Normal, IL, but have spent most of my life in Portland, OR.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I don't have time for hobbies but if I did, I like anything with water! Ocean, lakes, pools, hot tubs, all my faves!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Not opposed to being a trophy wife but since that hasn't worked so far I would either like to own my own web developer business or work for one in a managment position.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Portland, OR</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Just having my tip toes in the field I have so many people wanting sites or help, and some I can help and most I just don't have the education... Yet! I love the field. I love the creativity mixed with logic and essentially mathmatics. If you know the equation you can find the answer, or if you know the code you can create the content.</p>
